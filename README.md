# University-Management-System
This project is a University Management System implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to manage students, courses, and faculty in a university setting efficiently through a console-based interface.
## Features
- **Student Management:** Add, delete, update, and view student information. Track courses taken by students.  
- **Course Management:** Add, delete, update, and view course details. Track enrolled students in each course.  
- **Faculty Management:** Add, delete, update, and view faculty information.  
- **Student-Course Association:** Assign students to courses and courses to students.  
- **Information Display:** Print details of students, courses, faculty, and their relationships.  
- **Search Functionality:** Search students, courses, and faculty by ID or name, and check course enrollment or teaching assignments.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface:** User-friendly console menu to navigate all functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- Java (OOP concepts: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, ArrayLists)  
- Console-based interaction using `Scanner`

## Purpose
This project demonstrates practical application of **OOP concepts** in Java for real-world scenarios like managing a university system, including relationships between students, courses, and faculty.
